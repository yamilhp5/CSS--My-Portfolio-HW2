There were a few challenges I faced when creating my online portfolio from nothing. Some of the challenges during this homework was trying to build the content-boxes for each of the future projects. I had to pay attention to every little details as sizes, numbers, pixels, text etc, that contains creating a website. This situation created a better understanding of each command for CSS. Developers have the opportunity to create and modify their website to improve the user experience and help others to make the website they desired for their business. For me, the hardest part of this homework was designing the CSS page and without any html references. I really look forward to make anmends to my portfolio based on the feedback provided once is being reviewed.
